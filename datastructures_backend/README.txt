This is the backend code for a school project application.
The program saves objects called "xpoints/fibres" and "beacons" using c++ standard library datastructures 
and is able performs operations and searches on them. These functions are optimized to have a low asymptotic running time.
The project is for a course called "datastructures and algorithms".
