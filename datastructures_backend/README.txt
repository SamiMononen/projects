This is the backend code for a school project application.

The program saves objects called "xpoints/fibres" and "beacons" using c++ standard library datastructures and is able performs operations and searches on them. These functions are optimized to have a low asymptotic running time.

The project is for a course called "datastructures and algorithms".

The documentation PNG is screenshotted from the project instructions and is in Finnish.

IMPORTANT 
The application can't be run with just these files, I only included these files because everything else was provided by the course staff.
